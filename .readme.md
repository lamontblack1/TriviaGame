This trivia game uses javascript, timers, and jquery to dynamically create elements that are used for the game.
New questions and final score are automatically displayed based on the timer. 

I worked on the color theme, choosing colors from the background image for the background of the main div and the border. I learned how to have the bootstrap buttons have the same default color as the background of the div they are in, but when hovered over have the bootstrap background and text color.

The randomizer array is used to randomize the order the questions are displayed in, but the first answer of the question in the questions array is always the correct answer. That made it easy to test for a right answer click.

I also learned that assigning a variable to a jquery-grabbed element makes it behave like a jquery element later in the code. (i.e newDiv.hmtl("") instead of newDiv.innerHtml = ""). That was an annoying time consumer.

Somewhat challenging also was centering the gif display.

I like the cute gifs I found. Check them all out by playing all 5 questions.

* On the final screen, show the number of correct answers, incorrect answers, and an option to restart the game (without reloading the page).
